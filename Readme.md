# [Epoch Super Cassette Vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Cassette_Vision) core for [MISTer Platform](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki)

This is a first-order approximation emulator of the Epoch Super Cassette Vision.

The best documentation I could find is embodied in the [MAME](https://www.mamedev.org) SCV emulator. Takeda-san's [eSCV](http://takeda-toshiya.my.coocan.jp/scv/index.html) and related documents were also very helpful. NEC data sheets of the uCOM-87 microcontroller series provided instruction cycle timings and were found around the 'net. The gaps (and there are many) were filled with educated guesses and prior art from building emulators for MOS6502-based machines and the SNES.
